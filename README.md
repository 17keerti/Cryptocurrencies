# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment in cryptocurrencies. Data needs to be processed to fit the machine learning models. I have used unsupervised learning, clustering algorithm and data visualizations to share findings.
